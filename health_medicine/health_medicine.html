		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">Health care innovations occur across a spectrum, ranging from small changes that improve some aspect of health care to major shifts that have sweeping effects on the entire health care industry. As discussed below, disruptive innovation involves fundamental shifts in thinking about the «four Ws» of service delivery and its economics. Other examples of disruptive innovation in the general business world include the introduction of personal computers, the availability of ATMs and Internet banking, access to paralegals and Web sites that provide basic legal advice, and the spread of distance learning in higher education. The health care system has witnessed disruptive innovation caused by the marketing of home blood glucose monitors for people with diabetes, the launch of retail primary care clinics staffed by nurses and nurse practitioners, and the development of oral chemotherapy regimens.

		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">The success of Intuitive Surgical’s Da Vinci system has spurred a number of commercial ventures that have attracted large financial investments, such as Mako Surgical, Auris Medical, Medorobotics, and Mazor Robotics, and these efforts will continue their drive to improve health care in terms of both outcomes and costs. Recently, Google and Johnson & Johnson have teamed with the intention of creating next-generation medical robot systems. Although the clinical robotic systems used to date are assistive and lack any real autonomy, this will certainly change. As our understanding of how to use robotics in the clinic matures, we will continue to develop a deeper understanding of how to create more intelligent, more capable surgical robots.

The journal is particularly interested in highlighting in vivo and first-use-in-human efforts, as well as fundamental advances in micro- and nanorobotics. This would thus increase unemployement for nurses and doctors since the robot assistant would be able to accomplish the tasks.

		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">They can learn from a corpus of data and apply diagnoses based on precedent better than a human working from experience or memory ever could. They can perform surgery with more precision than a shaky human hand could. NewtonX assembled a large panel of senior healthcare professionals including 50 senior practitioners, 50 SVP level executives at large Healthcare providers, and 50 VP-level executives at large Healthcare providers. This panel has been leveraged both for qualitative as well as quantitative insights, both of which inform the angles in this article.

		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">Even the most sophisticated AI-based machines cannot do the work of most doctors. But it is undeniable there are key applications for robotics that enable better treatment options and lower risk for patients. According to the NewtonX panel of 50 Healthcare Providers, 22% of the work currently done by medical personnel could be automated either through the use of simple Digital Solutions, more advanced AI or Automation, or even Robotics. However, there is significant variance across specialties, as well as in the kind of work required .

		<h2 style="color:white"> 3D printing </h2>
		<img src ="3d.jpg" width ="290" height="240" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">Additive manufacturing, otherwise known as 3D printing, was first developed in the 1980s. It involves taking a digital model or blueprint of the subject that is then printed in successive layers of an appropriate material to create a new version of the subject. The technique has been applied to many different industries, including medical technology. Often medical imaging techniques, such as X-rays, computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging scans and ultrasounds are used to produce the original digital model, which is subsequently fed into the 3D printer. 
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">The industry’s compound annual growth rate is supposed to reach 17.7% between 2017 and 2025. One of the many types of 3D printing that is used in the medical device field is bioprinting. In May 2018, the company presented pre-clinical data for the functionality of its liver tissue in a programme for type 1 tyrosinemia, a condition that impedes the body’s ability to metabolise the amino acid tyrosine due to the deficiency of an enzyme. The Wake Forest Institute in North Carolina, US, adopted a similar approach by developing a 3D brain organoid with potential applications in drug discovery and disease modelling.

		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">The university announced in May 2018 that it’s organoids have a fully cell-based, functional blood brain barrier that mimics normal human anatomy.
