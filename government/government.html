		<p style="color:white"; align="justify"> In the wake of the deep austerity facing many governments around the world, leaders are faced with the challenge to do more with less. Disruptive innovation challenges the notion that there must be a tradeoff between price and quality of service. This paper advances the argument that disruptive innovation can thrive in the public sector and show its benefits in public services.

		<h2 style="color:white"> Blockchain  </h2>
		<img src ="block.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify"> Although the codes are open and public for users to see, Blockchain is one of the most secure technologies available today. All the information is stored on an encrypted digital ledger on multiple devices across the network, so even if a device malfunctions, the data can be retrieved by other devices on the network. It does not allow users to alter the present data. Blockchain was first used in Bitcoin. 
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">It is a cryptocurrency, used as a medium of exchange for digital transactions. It uses cryptography to verify as well as secure transactions. The tech community has started acknowledging the potential of Blockchain for other aspects also. Healthcare industry can also benefit by using Blockchain technology. 
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">These data can be altered to show a positive record for a clinical trial. Blockchain can help to secure the data, as once entered, data cannot be altered. This can help in making the trials transparent and fair. Blockchain can help to track a medicine from production to distribution. 
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">It is safe from all types of data breaches which will create a transparency in supply-chain. Instead of multiple billing locations, the bills can be stored on a Blockchain network. A patient can check his bills at any time. Since its inception tech companies have found many aspects of Blockchain usage.
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify"> Healthcare industry should also utilize this technology to ensure data security, faster and transparent system.

		<h2 style="color:white"> Augmented Reality </h2>
		<img src ="ag.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">Very often, customers have a different belief about what the product should be and what they actually receive stands miles away from that belief. Another case is that, though buyers often prefer endlessly customizable products and options, salespeople balk at this idea in a belief that customization might interfere with various metrics of the product. Moreover, it is not easy for manufacturers to keep up with uniquely tailored goods for each customer. This is where the role of augmented reality and 3D visualization comes in the sales arena. 
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">AR creates a visual universe to look at products in a more compelling way. Enterprise AR can use a tangible Index or fiducial target to establish a monument. When pointed at the target, camera-enabled devices like smartphones, tablets, and head-up displays depict the product in a visual format. These applications offer a whole new world of immersive experience for the customers as they can have a virtual view of the actual product, which means greater satisfaction, personalization, and loyalty.

		<h2 style="color:white"> AI </h2>
		<img src ="ai.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">AI has the potential to increase productivity, reduce the tendency to make biased decisions and improve safety. Applying artificial intelligence in the government can make services faster and more tailored.
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">AI use in the government, as the private initiative can take advantage of them. One way in which the government could make the most out of AI is by financial analysis for taxation purposes. No more tax evasion or double taxation. This would in turn put the personel out of a job who usually do the tax calculations manually such as accounts.
