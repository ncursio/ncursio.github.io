		<h1 style= "color:white"> Disruptive Communication </h1>
		<img src ="icon.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">Talk across silos, collaborate across time zones and communicate without borders.
		</p>
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify"> Collaboration and communication – there are few words as abused and overused as these, especially within the business context. Thrown into HR and business meetings, laid out as key performance indicators and generally used as whips in inter-office political manoeuvres, collaboration and communication are often key, essential and unique. They are also being disrupted.
		</p>
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">Technology is having a positive impact on how organisations communicate, collaborate and engage with people. The enterprise dynamic is changing because it has to. Choice has been taken out of the equation, certainly if the enterprise plans on being successful over the long term.
		</p>
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">Mobile offices and hot desks are becoming the new normal, and mobile and cloud solutions make collaboration from anywhere, anytime and on any device more effective and efficient. Enterprises need to deliver a multi-channel strategy both internally and externally as people are looking for more ways to use technology for instant communication and collaboration.
		</p>
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">Shifts in how and where people work are allowing for deeper communication and richer collaboration. Tools such as Asana, Podio, Slack, Igloo, Workfront, Google, Skype and Atlassian come with extensive feature sets and capabilities, and enterprises are starting to pay attention.
		</p>
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">The digital landscape, backed by cloud computing, is bringing with it the unique opportunity for organisations to reshape themselves. We are seeing a transition towards more collaborative, multi-channel operating models focused on improving organisation efficiencies and enhancing customer service.
		</p>

		<h2 style= "color:white"> I’ll be watching you </h2>
		<img src ="skype.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify"> Video conferencing is also on the rise as its software becomes more user-friendly and available across multiple channels. If one side of a video conference is conducted through traditional systems, the other side usually needs the same, but new technologies are emerging that enable interoperability between systems. With mobile communication applications, collaboration is enabled anytime, anywhere. It does need to be about more than just sharing knowledge and information. The differentiation here is that knowledge has already been processed in an understandable and usable way, it is useful and relevant and can be used to make a decision.
		</p>
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">It means the business can leap from one challenge, opportunity and innovation to the next with the grace of a bionic gazelle. Few businesses are really there, but the changes in collaborative technology architecture are giving them access to the tools they need to get there. The combination of rapid technological change, the generational shift and the ongoing globalisation of business has forever changed the face of communication. In an inherently globalised economy, the ability to support asynchronous collaboration can mean the difference between winning and losing.

		<h2 style= "color:white"> Cloud </h2>
		<img src ="cloud.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style ="color:white"; align ="justify">The cloud has completely changed how accessible everything in our digital lives can be. Other than the collectors and hoarders, most of us would say we haven't bought a CD in years, but our music is still with us each and every day. Communication as we know it is being disrupted. It lives at the center of our universe and has driven our lives both B2B and B2C to a simple common existence sometimes referred to as Peer to Peer .
		</p>
		
		<p style ="color:white"; align ="justify"> Social, mobile, big data and cloud have changed our lives, changed the way we communicate and will continue to revolutionize the business enterprise of the future.

		<h2 style= "color:white"> The statistics of poor communication and bedraggled collaboration </h2>
		<img src ="graph.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">According to research done by Salesforce, 96% of executives believe that a lack of communication and collaboration is the reason why workplaces fail and, perhaps more importantly, they are the reason why employees leave a company. HR Zone found that poor communication and collaboration are the direct cause of up to 30% of employee retention issues. If people can’t communicate effectively, and this is particularly true of the millennials, they don’t flourish and often opt for careers that may have less pay, but greater engagement. Enterprises have traditionally segmented responsibilities into silos, which has led to a methodology-based approach to problem-solving, says Jeremy Potgieter, regional director, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eseye. Solutions such as Skype for Business have become commonplace and are reducing the need for business travel.
		</p>
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">Yes, only 20% of e-mails are done properly. Who knew? The McKinsey Global Institute Study found that high-skill knowledge workers spend 19% of their average work week searching for, and gathering, information, says Tony Rolston, CEO, APMXperts. That’s an incredible amount of productive time lost and something collaborative solutions can address. 
		</p> 
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">As technology races ahead, it can leave many people behind. Workers whose skills have been mastered by computers have less to offer the job market, and see their wages and prospects shrink. Their statement is not an opinion. Still, the net effect of the consolidation is replacing workers with automated mechanisms. This is due to the complexity of the existing systems and the length of time required to migrate to cloud based platforms without disruptions of service
		</p> 
		
		<p style= "color:white"; align="justify">In the long term, we suspect the balance will be positive if we take into account newly created jobs. In fact, cloud enables most start-ups to implement and sell ideas with a minimum initial investment. The newly created jobs will mostly belong to a new kind of worker. They require new skills, an entrepreneurial approach, flexibility, agility and the ability to learn new skills quickly.
