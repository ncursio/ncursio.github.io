		<h1 style="color:white"> Disruptive Education</h1>
		<img src ="ed.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify"> Disruptive technologies provide the possibility to get a modern education to those people who don't have the possibility to learn in traditional educational institutions due to scheduling issues. Web-based software allows applying for the services of educational organization and learning without leaving your own house.
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">Excitement about the role of technology in improving education is a good thing as far as I’m concerned. Let’s face it - there is a general sense that the current education system is not up to the challenges of the future. And, it’s not clear how we get from here to there. It could be argued that any individual that is putting time into educational technology leadership at any level is an investor, but certainly institutions that are spending on innovation, and yes, venture capital investors .

		<h2 style ="color:white"> Online Learning </h2>
		<img src ="online.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">Online learning technology has done a significant job of changing how higher education institutions operate, educate, and innovate over the past few years. While MOOCs may not have been all they were cracked up to be, other innovations in online learning have helped make Higher Ed more accessible, opened up new opportunities for students, and changed how many view the value of an online education.
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">Non-traditional students, such as parents and those fully employed, had often been inaccessible due to scheduling issues, but now have access to a higher education thanks to advances in online learning.
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify"> Despite online learning’s successes, many still believe that it lacks the interaction of its in-person counterpart. For example, video communication technology now allows professors to teach from the comfort of their homes while still being able to speak directly to their students. Those students are also able to work more closely together, as they would in a traditional classroom. Additionally, professors are able to have experts from their field join the discussion online to speak with students directly.

		<h2 style ="color:white"> Competency-based Education </h2>
		<img src ="cbe.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">Competency-based Education is the approach implying that all students enter the educational program with different skills and each of them has different speed of learning. The primary task is to measure these differences and create adaptive learning programs. The goal is to increase student engagement in education and avoid the situation when students have to learn what they already know. CBE allows making the educational process more individual-focused which results in more efficient learning. 
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">If a learner needs more time to focus on a particular topic, CBE systems allow this need to be precisely measured. This disruptive technology in education has enabled pedagogy to meet the needs of students that don’t fit match the strict criteria of a «traditional» learner. Custom eLearning development companies can create business Intelligence tools providing efficient ways of analyzing data. Educational organizations can use student dashboards to assess the educational progress of a specific learner.

		<h2 style ="color:white">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
		<img src ="ai.jpg" width ="240" height="240" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom">
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">While artificial intelligence may not currently be taking Higher Ed by storm, its potential for disruption is evident in its rise in mainstream popularity. IBM’s Watson captivated Jeopardy! audiences when it was able to compete against human contestants. Intelligent personal assistants like Siri and Cortana show how useful A.I. can be in day-to-day activities. Imagine having an A.I. professor’s assistant or an online learning platform that adapts to each student’s specific needs. Having artificial intelligence that learns and improves as it aids in the learning process could have a far-reaching effect on higher education both online and in-person.
		</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"; align="justify">While Higher Ed may not be as prone to disruption as other industries, there are certain technologies that have undeniably disrupted how students learn, professors teach, and how universities operate. This will in turn affect teachers and lectures since their primary job would be replaced by AI's. This would increase the amount of unemployeed teachers in the future for jamiaca.
